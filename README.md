- This is a project of a clock 
- A simple training on timers and GPIO
- This code is not a layered model-based, but I want to save it like that way because it is my first ever embedded systems project
- The project works by 6 seven segments using the multiplexing technique , and it counts the time for every second.
- It includes buttons to reset, hold, continue counting time
